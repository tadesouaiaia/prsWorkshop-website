## Exercise 1 Estimating R<sup>2</sup> in case and control studies
Bias in R<sup>2</sup> estimation caused by ascertained case/control samples can be adjusted using the equation proposed by **Lee et al (2011)**, which requires the sample prevalence (case/control ratio) and population prevalence as parameters. This function is implemented in PRSice and the adjustment can be performed by providing the population prevalence to the command **--prevalence**.

Residuals of logistic regression is not well defined, and in PRS analyses, Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup> is usually used to represent the model R<sup>2</sup> (this is the default of PRSice). However, this R<sup>2</sup> does not account for the diÔ¨Äerence between sample prevalence (i.e. case-control ratio) and population prevalence, which can lead to bias in the reported R<sup>2</sup> (Figure 1.1a).

Bias in R<sup>2</sup> estimation caused by ascertained case/control samples can be adjusted using the equation proposed by **Lee et al. 2011 (Figure 1.1b)**, which requires the sample
prevalence (case/control ratio) and population prevalence as parameters. This function is implemented in PRSice and the adjustment can be performed by providing the population prevalence to the command **--prevalence**.

Now, account for the ascertainment of the case/control sample by including the population prevalence (let‚Äôs assume e.g. 5% here) in the PRSice command to obtain the adjusted (Lee) R<sup>2</sup> :

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
--prsice Software/PRSice_mac \
--base  Base_Data/Cardio_CAD.txt  \
--target Target_Data/TAR \
--snp markername \
--A1 effect_allele \
--A2 noneffect_allele \
--chr chr \
--bp bp_hg19 \
--stat beta \
--beta \
--pvalue p_dgc \
--pheno Target_Data/TAR.cad \
--prevalence 0.05 \
--binary-target T \
--out Results/CAD.highres.LEER2
```
The results are written to the "Results" directory. Examine the results folder and each file that was generated. For more information about each file type, see  [here](https://choishingwan.github.io/PRSice/step_by_step/).

## Exercise 2 Overfitting caused by model optimisation

In PRS analyses, the shrinkage or tuning parameter is usually optimized across a wide range of parametric space (e.g. P -value threshold, proportion of causal SNPs). When both optimisation and association testing are performed on the target data, over-fitted results will be obtained. The accuracy and predictive power of over-fitted results are likely to diminish when replicated in an independent data set.

A simple solution is to perform permutation to obtain an empirical P -value for the association model, which is implemented in PRSice. Briefly, permutation is performed as follows:
1) Compute the P -value in your original data, denoted as obs.p, at the "best" threshold.
2) Then shuÔ¨Ñe the phenotype and obtain the P -value of the "best" threshold for this null phenotype, denoted as null.p
3) Repeat 2) N times
4) Calculate the empirical P-value as:

 $` Pemp = (\sum(obs.p > null.pi + 1) / (N + 1) `$
---

You will have to specify the number of permutation (N ) to perform by providing --perm N as a parameter to PRSice.

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
    --prsice Software/PRSice_mac \
    --base  Base_Data/GIANT_Height.txt \
    --target Target_Data/TAR \

### Out of Sample Validation

The best way to avoid having results that are over-fit is to perform validation on an independent validation data set. We can perform validation of the previous height + covariate analysis with PRSice, using the independent VAL target sample as validation data and the "best" P-value threshold predicted in the VAL samples:

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
    --prsice Software/PRSice_mac \
    --base  Base_Data/GIANT_Height.txt \
    --target Target_Data/VAL \
    --snp MarkerName \
    --A1 Allele1 \
    --A2 Allele2 \
    --stat b \
    --beta \
    --pvalue p \
    --pheno Target_Data/VAL.height \
    --binary-target F \
    --no-full \
    --bar-levels 0.0680001 \
    --fastscore \
    --cov Target_Data/VAL.covariate \
    --cov-col Sex \
    --out Results/Height.val
```

## Exercise 3 Distribution of PRS

Many PRS study publications include quantile plots that show an exponential increase in phenotypic value or / Odd Ratios (OR) among the top quantiles (e.g. an S-shaped quantile plot, e.g. Figure 1.6).

  **Figure 1.5: An example of density plot for PRS**

---

This might lead us to believe that individuals with PRS values in the top quantiles have a distinctly diÔ¨Äerent genetic aetiology compared to the rest of the sample, or that there is epistasis/interactions causing there substantially higher risk. However, when we plot a normally distributed variable (e.g. a PRS) as quantiles on the X-axis then we expect to observe this exponential pattern even when the X variable only has a linear eÔ¨Äect on the Y variable. This is because the top (and bottom) quantiles are further away from each other on the absolute scale of the variable and so the diÔ¨Äerences in their eÔ¨Äects are larger than between quantiles in the middle of the distribution.

To understand this more, we will perform a simple simulation using R:
```
R
# First, we define some simulation parameters
n.sample <- 10000
PRS.r2 <- 0.01
# Then, we simulate PRS that follow a random normal distribution
prs <- rnorm(n.sample)
# We can then simulate the phenotype using the following script
pheno <- prs + rnorm(n.sample,mean=0, sd=sqrt(var(prs)*(1-PRS.r2)/(PRS.r2)))
# We can examine the relationship between the phenotype and prs 
# using linear regression
summary(lm(pheno~prs))
# Which shows that we have the expected PRS R2
# Group the phenotype and PRS into a data.frame
info <- data.frame(SampleID=1:n.sample, PRS=prs, Phenotype=pheno)
# Then we can generate the quantile plot. 
# To save time, we will load in the quantile plot script from Software
source("./Software/Quantile.R")
# Then we can plot the quantile plot using quantile_plot function
quantile_plot(info, "Results/Height", 100)
```
