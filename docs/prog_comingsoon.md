# PRS Japan Workshop is Almost Here!: Aug 30, 2024 


This short course will equip scientists based in Japan with tools and approaches for polygenic risk scores (PRS) analysis. The course will cover both applied and theoretical topics in PRS research, delivered across a
variety of lectures, tutorials, computational practicals and special guest seminars from experts in the field. By the end of the workshop, attendees should have an in-depth theoretical understanding and practical skills
in PRS analysis of global populations.

The course will begin with an overview of genome-wide association studies, an introduction to PRS analysis, advanced topics in PRS (e.g., pathway-based PRS, PRS Environment interactions, PRS to identify rare variants).
This will be followed by the key topic of the ‘PRS Portability Problem’ and how to address it using PRS methods developed for application to diverse and admixed ancestry samples. Finally, attendees will devise, perform
and present their own research project as part of a group on a topic relevant to the content of the course, with feedback from the workshop team.
