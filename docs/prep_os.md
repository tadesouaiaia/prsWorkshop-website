# Operating System 

This workshop is designed to help students run statistical genetic analysis.  In practice large-scale data analysis is almost always done using 
a server or cloud-based system running a Linux operating system.  For this reason a Linux based operating system is recommended and users 
running MacOs ([see here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview)) or Windows ([see here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
are encouraged to install Linux if possible.  However, due to the similarity between Unix based operating systems, this workshop and tutorial can be completed in Linux and macOs 
environments and is described for users with both operating systems. Microsoft windows users are required to install Linux and as such, we provide detailed [instructions](misc_linux.md) to do so. 





**This workshop is designed for either of the following operating systems:** 

1. Linux: A Debian compatible Linux based operating system (Ubuntu, Mint, etc).  
2. macOS: A recent version (11+) of the Desktop OS. 
3. Microsoft Windows: **Is not supported, but instructions to install Linux can be found [here.](misc_linux)**
